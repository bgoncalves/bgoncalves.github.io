For the past six years, my research has focused on the future of AI as envisioned by Alan Turing (1912-1954), his machines and games, the foundations and ethics of AI, the future of machines in society & nature. I have 12+ years of research & development experience in AI and data-centric systems in academia and industry.

I am a Staff Research Scientist at the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing (LNCC), an institute of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation of the Federal Republic of Brazil. There I am founding the Turing Futures Lab. I am also Associate Editor of the _IEEE Annals of the History of Computing_, and an Associate Researcher at the Center for AI (C4AI) of the University of São Paulo, where I participate in the Knowledge-Enhanced Machine Learning group. I was a Visiting Fellow (2023-2024) of King's College, Cambridge, and [a Research Affiliate](https://web.archive.org/web/20241208103715/https://www.hps.cam.ac.uk/directory/affiliates){:target="_blank"} of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge. My former research project lasted four years and was based at the Polytechnic School, University of São Paulo, Brazil. It was entitled ["The Future of AI: the Logical Structure of Alan Turing's Argument"](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/191927/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-the-logical-structure-of-alan-turings-argument/){:target="_blank"} (supported by The São Paulo Research Foundation under grant 2019/21489-4). The output of this project includes:

Previously, I have worked in designing, developing, and deploying AI systems as [a permanent Research Scientist](http://web.archive.org/web/20170115141702/http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=br-bng){:target="_blank"} at IBM Research (2016-2020) and contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger, and Gazprom Neft.

My work has appeared in [_Minds & Machines_](https://www.springer.com/journal/11023){:target="_blank"}, [_Artificial Intelligence_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence){:target="_blank"}, [_AI & Society_](https://www.springer.com/journal/146){:target="_blank"}, [_Philosophy & Technology_](https://www.springer.com/journal/13347){:target="_blank"}, [_IEEE Annals of the History of Computing_](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/an){:target="_blank"}, [_Annals of Science_](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tasc20){:target="_blank"}, [_International Journal of Approximate Reasoning_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-approximate-reasoning){:target="_blank"}, [_IEEE Computing in Science & Engineering_](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/about/14587){:target="_blank"}, and [_Proceedings of the Very Large Databases_Endowment](https://www.vldb.org/){:target="_blank"}. 

I earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy (University of São Paulo, 2021), a Ph.D. in Computational Modeling (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, 2015), and M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (Federal University of Espírito Santo, 2009 and 2007). In 2016-2020, I was a permanent research scientist at IBM Research, and in 2015 I was a visiting scholar in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am a member of the Association for the History and Philosophy of Science of the Southern Cone ([AFHIC](http://www.afhic.com/){:target="_blank"}) and a former member of the Science, Technology & Society group _Scientiae Studia_ at the University of São Paulo (2017-2019), led by Galileo scholar Prof. Pablo Mariconda.
