I am a scientist and philosopher specialized on the conceptual foundations of AI & machine learning. My approach is analytical and historiographic. I have 10+ years of experience with AI applications, and I observe closely the potentials and implications of AI & machine learning in society. 

My current project is entitled "The Future of AI: the Logical Structure of Alan Turing's Argument" (supported by The São Paulo State Research Foundation under grant# 19/21489-4). I have been studying Alan Turing's contributions to the mind-machine controversy in England (1946-1952) and his views about the future capabilities of digital computers. These are articulated in the vivid image of the Turing Test, as detailed in my forthcoming book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London, NY: Routledge, under contract). My most recent working papers are 'The Turing Test is a Thought Experiment', and is ['Dystopian or Utopian? Two Images of Alan Turing'](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/20533/){:target="_blank"}.

I've worked in the design, development and deployment of AI systems as a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020), having contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger and Grazprom Neft.
