I am a scientist in AI and data science. Here's [my entry at DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/35/1880.html).

In the latest years I took a break from my computer science work, then at IBM Research, to study the Turing Test from the point of view of philosophy. This led me to earn a second Ph.D., in Philosophy (University of São Paulo, 2021). My first Ph.D. degree is in Computational Modeling (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, 2015). As a result of my philosophy work on Alan Turing's views about the mind-machine controversy and the possibilities of future machines, I am publishing the book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London: Routledge, to appear in 2022). 

Currently my research is centered on causal discovery and inference. My goal is to contribute to make the study of cause-effect relationships scalable and ready to be delivered to various industries.
