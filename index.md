For the past five years, my research has focused on the future of AI as envisioned by Alan Turing (1912-1954), his machines and games, the foundations of AI, the future of machines in society & nature, and the Anthropocene. I have 12+ years of research & development experience in AI and data-centric systems.

I have been elected a Visiting Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and have been based in Cambridge/UK, since May 2023. Since October 2023 I am also a Research Associate of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge. My current project is entitled ["The Future of AI: the Logical Structure of Alan Turing's Argument"](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/191927/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-the-logical-structure-of-alan-turings-argument/){:target="_blank"} (supported by The São Paulo Research Foundation under grant #19/21489-4). The output of this project includes:

Previously, I have worked in designing, developing, and deploying AI systems as a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2019) and contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger, and Gazprom Neft.

My work has appeared in [_Annals of Science_](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tasc20){:target="_blank"}, [_Philosophy & Technology_](https://www.springer.com/journal/13347){:target="_blank"}, [_Minds & Machines_](https://www.springer.com/journal/11023){:target="_blank"}, [_AI & Society_](https://www.springer.com/journal/146){:target="_blank"}, [_Artificial Intelligence_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence){:target="_blank"}, [_International Journal of Approximate Reasoning_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-approximate-reasoning){:target="_blank"}, [_Computing in Science & Engineering_](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/about/14587){:target="_blank"}, and [_Proceedings of the VLDB_](https://www.vldb.org/){:target="_blank"}. 

As a referee, I have contributed to _Artificial Intelligence Review_ (2023), _IEEE Annals of the History of Computing_ (2023), _Studies in History and Philosophy of Science_ (2023), _AI & Society_ (2022), _Principia_ (Florianópolis, 2022), _THEORIA_ (Basque Country, 2023), _Diametros_ (Kraków, 2023). 

I earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy (University of São Paulo, 2021), a Ph.D. in Computational Modeling (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, 2015), and M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (Federal University of Espírito Santo, 2009 and 2007). In 2016-2019, I was a permanent research scientist at IBM Research, and in 2015 I was a visiting scholar in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am a member of the Association for the History and Philosophy of Science of the Southern Cone ([AFHIC](http://www.afhic.com/){:target="_blank"}) and a former member of the Science, Technology & Society group _Scientiae Studia_ at the University of São Paulo (2017-2019), led by Galileo scholar Prof. Pablo Mariconda. 

In the Faculty of Philosophy, Languages, and Humanities at the University of São Paulo, I have taken graduate courses on the philosophy of history (e.g., the idea of progress in Cicero, Machiavelli, Voltaire and Rousseau, and Walter Benjamin's theses), history of economics (e.g., the formation of the modern state in England), ancient and modern skepticism (Pyrrho, Montaigne, Descartes), early modern science (Galileo and the Renaissance, Descartes and mechanicism), in addition to having read classics in the history and the philosophy of science such as Duhem, Popper, Kuhn, Hacking. At the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, I have taken graduate courses in theoretical computer science, mathematical modeling, real analysis, numerical analysis, tensor calculus, and the calculus of variations. 

Thanks for visiting!
