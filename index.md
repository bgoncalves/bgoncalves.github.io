I am a scientist and philosopher doing research in AI & machine learning, and their potentials and impacts in industry and society. My current project is entitled "The Future of AI: the Logical Structure of Alan Turing's Argument" (supported by The São Paulo State Research Foundation under grant# [19/21489-4](http://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/191927/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-the-logical-structure-of-alan-turings-argument/){:target="_blank"}). 

I have been studying Alan Turing's contributions to the mind-machine controversy in England (1946-1952) and his views about the future capabilities of digital computers. These are articulated in the vivid image of the Turing Test, as detailed in my forthcoming book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London, NY: Routledge, to appear in early 2023). 

As a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020), I've worked in the design, development and deployment of AI systems, having contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger and Grazprom Neft.
