I am a scientist, engineer and philosopher in AI and data science. Here's [DBLP entry](https://dblp.org/pid/35/1880.html){:target="_blank"}.

As a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020), I've worked in the design, development and delivery of AI systems, having contributed to large projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger and Grazprom Neft. 

In the latest years I slowed down my computer science work to study the Turing Test from the point of view of philosophy. This led me to earn a second Ph.D., in Philosophy (University of São Paulo, 2021). My first Ph.D. degree is in Computational Modeling (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, 2015). As a result of my philosophy work on Alan Turing's views about the mind-machine controversy and the future capabilities of machines, I am publishing the book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London, NY: Routledge, to appear in 2022). 

Currently I'm getting back to my computer science work, which is centered on data-driven causal discovery and inference. My goal is to contribute to make the study of cause-effect relationships, which may be implicit in data, scalable and ready to be delivered to various industries.
