I have been elected a Visiting Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, and am based in Cambridge since May 2023. 

My research focuses on Alan Turing (1912-1954), his machines and games, AI, the future of machines in society & nature, the Anthropocene. 

My work has appeared in [_Annals of Science_](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/tasc20){:target="_blank"}, [_Philosophy & Technology_](https://www.springer.com/journal/13347){:target="_blank"}, [_Minds & Machines_](https://www.springer.com/journal/11023){:target="_blank"}, [_AI & Society_](https://www.springer.com/journal/146){:target="_blank"}, [_Artificial Intelligence_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence){:target="_blank"}, [_International Journal of Approximate Reasoning_](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-approximate-reasoning){:target="_blank"}, [_Computing in Science & Engineering_](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/cs/about/14587){:target="_blank"}, and [_Proceedings of the VLDB_](https://www.vldb.org/){:target="_blank"}. As a referee, I have contributed to _IEEE Annals of the History of Computing_, _Studies in History and Philosophy of Science_, _AI & Society_, _Principia_ (Florianópolis, Brazil), _THEORIA_ (Basque Country), _Diametros_ (Kraków, Poland). 


My current project is entitled ["The Future of AI: the Logical Structure of Alan Turing's Argument"](https://bv.fapesp.br/en/bolsas/191927/the-future-of-artificial-intelligence-the-logical-structure-of-alan-turings-argument/){:target="_blank"} (supported by The São Paulo State Research Foundation under grant #19/21489-4). The output of this project includes: 

_The Turing Test Argument_ (in production at Routledge)

Previously, I have worked in designing, developing, and deploying AI systems as a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020) and contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger, and Gazprom Neft.

I earned my second Ph.D., in Philosophy (University of São Paulo, 2021), as a result of a recent career shift from computer science, the field in which I earned my first Ph.D. in Computational Modeling (National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, 2015), and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees. In 2016-2019, I was a permanent research scientist at IBM Research, and in 2015 I was a visiting scholar in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I am a member of the Association for the History and Philosophy of Science of the Southern Cone ([AFHIC](http://www.afhic.com/){:target="_blank"}) and a former member of the Science, Technology & Society group _Scientiae Studia_ at the University of São Paulo (2017-2019), led by Galileo scholar Prof. Pablo Mariconda. 

In the Faculty of Philosophy, Languages, and Humanities at the University of São Paulo, I have taken graduate courses on the philosophy of history (e.g., the idea of progress in Cicero, Machiavelli, Voltaire and Rousseau, and Walter Benjamin's theses), history of economics (e.g., the formation of the modern state in England), ancient and modern skepticism (Pyrrho, Montaigne, Descartes), early modern science (Galileo and the Renaissance, Descartes and mechanicism), in addition to having read classics in the history and the philosophy of science such as Duhem, Popper, Kuhn, Hacking. At the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, I have taken graduate courses in theoretical computer science, mathematical modeling, real analysis, numerical analysis, tensor calculus, and the calculus of variations. 

Thanks for visiting!
