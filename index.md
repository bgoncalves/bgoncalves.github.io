I am a scientist, philosopher and consultant in AI and machine learning, currently initiating a consulting enterprise on the future of AI and machine learning in industry and society. 

As a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020), I've worked in the design, development and deployment of AI systems, having contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger and Grazprom Neft. 

In the latest years I slowed down my computer science work to study the Turing Test from the point of view of philosophy. (This led me to earn a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, in March 2021. My first Ph.D. is in Computational Modeling from the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, earned in 2015.) As a result of my philosophy work on Alan Turing's contributions to the mind-machine controversy in England (1946-1952) and his views about the future capabilities of digital computers, I am publishing the book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London, NY: Routledge, to appear later in 2022). 

"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth."
