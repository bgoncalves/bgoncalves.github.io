I am a scientist, engineer and philosopher in AI and data science. Here's my [DBLP entry](https://dblp.org/pid/35/1880.html){:target="_blank"}.

As a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020), I've worked in the design, development and deployment of AI systems, having contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger and Grazprom Neft. 

In the latest years I slowed down my computer science work to study the Turing Test from the point of view of philosophy. (This led me to earn a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of São Paulo, Brazil, in March 2021. My first Ph.D. is in Computational Modeling from the National Laboratory for Scientific Computing, Brazil, earned in 2015.) As a result of my philosophy work on Alan Turing's interventions in the mind-machine controversy in England (1946-1952) and his views about the future capabilities of digital computers, I am publishing the book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London, NY: Routledge, to appear later in 2022). 

Currently I'm getting back to my computer science work, which is centered on data-driven causal discovery and inference. Data, small and large, may hide cause-effect dependencies among variables. My goal is to contribute to make causal inference scalable and ready to be delivered to various industries.
