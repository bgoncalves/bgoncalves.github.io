I am a scientist and philosopher specialized on the history and conceptual foundations of computing, AI & machine learning. My approach is analytical and historiographical. I have 10+ years of experience with AI theory, systems and applications, and I observe closely the potentials and implications of computing, AI & machine learning in society. 

My current project is entitled "The Future of AI: the Logical Structure of Alan Turing's Argument" (supported by The São Paulo State Research Foundation under grant #19/21489-4). I have been studying Alan Turing's life and works, with an emphasis on his contributions to the mind-machine controversy in England (1946-1952) and his views about the future capabilities of digital computers. These are articulated in the vivid image of the Turing Test, as detailed in my forthcoming book _The Turing Test Argument_ (London, NY: Routledge, under contract). My most recent working papers are 'The Turing Test is a Thought Experiment', and is ['Dystopian or Utopian? Two Images of Alan Turing'](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/20533/){:target="_blank"}.

I've worked in the design, development and deployment of AI systems as a permanent research scientist at IBM Research (2016-2020), having contributed to large joint-development projects with oil & gas companies such as Galp Energy, Schlumberger and Grazprom Neft. 

I earned my second Ph.D., in Philosophy (2021, University of São Paulo), as a result of my career shift from computer science, the field in which I earned my other Ph.D. degree, in Computational Modeling (2015, National Laboratory for Scientific Computing), and my M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees. Also, I'm a member of the Association for the History and Philosophy of Science of the Southern Cone ([AFHIC](http://www.afhic.com/){:target="_blank"}), and I'm a former member of the Science, Technology & Society group _Scientiae Studia_ at the University of São Paulo (2017-2020). 

In the Faculty of Philosophy, Languages and Humanities at the University of São Paulo, I've taken graduate courses, for instance, in the philosophy of history (e.g., the idea of progress in Cicero, Machieval, Voltaire, Rousseau and others), history of economics (e.g., the formation of the modern state in England), ancient and modern skepticism (Pyrrhonian & neo-Pyrronhian, and a bit of Montaigne), and intellectual history, in addition to having read classics in the history and the philosophy of science such as Duhem, Popper, Kuhn, Hacking.
